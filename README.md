# AvNElytra
Plugin developed for the Avalon Network that:
 - Allows disabling of elytra flight.
 - Allows disabling of rocket boosting during elytra flight.
 - Allows servers to set a speed-limit on elytra flight.
 - USED to allow disabling of trident-riptide boosting during elytra flight. This is now handled client side and can't be done directly.
